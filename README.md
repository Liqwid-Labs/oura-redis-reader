# Oura Redis Reader

Oura Redis Reader is a package/script to estimate how long it'd take to fold over all the Oura events (through Redis) from the inception of the Liqwid Ada market until the tip. The reason this exists is because there is a chance that Aqueduct/the off-chain for Liqwid + Agora might be able to drop DB Sync usage in favor of Oura.
